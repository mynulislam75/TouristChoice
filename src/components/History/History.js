                            <small>Dubai's roots reach all the way back to the early Minoan period. The site where Dubai now lies used to be a vast mangrove swamp. By 3000BCE that swamp had dried up and become inhabitable.</small>

                            <small>The earliest mention of Dubai was recorded in 1095, in the Book of Geography by Andalusian-Arab geographer Abu Abdullah Al Bakri. Other records like the journal of Venetian pearl merchant Gaspero Balbi, dates back to 1580 when he visited the area for its pearl trade.</small>

                            <small>Records show that Dubai was a walled city in the early 1800s. The Al Fahidi Fort was built around the same time Dubai became a dependency. The wall on the Bur Dubai side extended from Al Fahidi Historical Neighbourhood through Al Fahidi Fort, ending at the Old Souk.</small>

                            <small>Under the Al Maktoum leadership, Dubai began to thrive remarkably. In 1894, trading in the area was given yet another boost, as new rules granted tax exemption for expatriates. This led to a huge influx in the number of foreign workers entering the city.</small>
